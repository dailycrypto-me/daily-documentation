# ðŸ“£ Solicit delegation

Each validator node must have a minimum of 500,000 DLY in delegation, otherwise it will not be eligible to participate in consensus. You may delegate this to your own node, or more commonly solicit delegation from the Daily community.&#x20;

Here are a few social channels where the Daily community congregates, &#x20;

* Daily's [Discord server](https://www.dailycrypto.me/discord)
* Daily's [Telegram group](https://www.dailycrypto.me/tg)
* Daily's [official Twitter](https://twitter.com/daily\_project)
