## Evaluation Criteria

Daily Grant Program is meant to fund projects that are,

* Decentralized: only truly permissionless and decentralized projects will be considered.
* Open-source: only projects founded on the idea of open collaboration and innovation will be considered.
* Uniquely contributes to Dailyâ€™s ecosystem: projects that add unique value to the Daily ecosystem will be prioritized. This can be a truly unique piece of technology or application, or it could simply be something that Dailyâ€™s ecosystem sorely lacks but already exists elsewhere.
* Clear use of funds: thoughtful, practical, and truthful explanation of how funds will be used to accomplish measurable milestones.
* Ability to execute: convince us that you have what it takes to not just execute but also persist till your vision comes to fruition.\


Daily Grant Program is NOT meant to be used for,

* Marketing: to ensure regulatory compliance, grants will only be given to fund technical development, not marketing.
* Substitute for venture funding: to ensure that ecosystem projects simultaneously can stand on their own with sufficient market and user validation, as well as minimizing the long-term undue influence of the Daily Grant Program on any ecosystem project, ensuring their independence.

##

## Grant Disbursement:

All grant funds will be disbursed through Daily's [Community Site](https://community.dailycrypto.me/) to the applicant's account with an approved KYC. Grants are disbursed according to the achievement of measurable milestones tied to use of funds as agreed upon between the applicant and the dev team conducting reviews. The Daily dev team will be available to meet with grant recipients on a regular basis, not only to receive updates on projects but also to see what help beyond the funds the dev team can help to provide.
