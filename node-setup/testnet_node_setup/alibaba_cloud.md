# Alibaba Cloud

## 1. Register to Alibaba Cloud(Aliyun)

You can use the following link to get a discount:

## 2. Create AccessKeyId and AccessKeySecret

You can create AccessKeyId and AccessKeySecret on this page:

[AccessKeyId and AccessKeySecret](https://usercenter.console.aliyun.com/#/manage/ak)

Make a note of that key. It only shows once, you have to save it, and we will use it in the next step.

## 3. Creating a Daily Node

{% hint style="danger" %}
If you are running this on Windows you will first need to install Windows Subsystem for Linux. You can use [this guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10).
{% endhint %}

Export your AccessKeyId and AccessKeySecret to your environment so that the node creation script can access it without prompting you for it:

```bash
export ALY_AK_ID=your_access_key_id
export ALY_AK_SECRET=your_access_key_secret
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
The script you fetch and run in the next step depends on the network you want to deploy your node to.   Please be sure to select between mainnet and testnet as desired.
{% endhint %}

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Mainnet" %}
Download and run the node install script for the type of node you wish to deploy:

**Mainnet Full Node:**

<pre class="language-bash"><code class="lang-bash"><strong>bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dailycrypto-me/daily-ops/master/scripts/one-click-Alibaba-Cloud.sh)" mainnet
</strong></code></pre>

**Mainnet Light Node:**

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dailycrypto-me/daily-ops/master/scripts/one-click-Alibaba-Cloud.sh)" mainnet light
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Testnet" %}
Download and run the node install script for the type of node you wish to deploy:

**Testnet Full Node:**

<pre class="language-bash"><code class="lang-bash"><strong>bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dailycrypto-me/daily-ops/master/scripts/one-click-Alibaba-Cloud.sh)" testnet
</strong></code></pre>

**Testnet Light Node:**

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dailycrypto-me/daily-ops/master/scripts/one-click-Alibaba-Cloud.sh)" testnet light
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

Now you should see a new droplet in your Aliyun account and you should receive an email with the resources creating details.

_NOTE: It takes a few minutes after the droplet starts to install the Daily Node software, please don't restart or stop the new ECS instance._

## 4. Check the logs

You can send commands via Cloud Assistant, so you needn't remember the ECS instance password:

![how to send commands](../../.gitbook/assets/alibaba\_cloud\_connect\_with\_assistant.png)

_NOTE: If you want to get the instance's password, you can reset password._

You can use the following commands to check if the node is up and running:

```bash
sudo docker ps

sudo docker logs daily_compose_node_1
```
