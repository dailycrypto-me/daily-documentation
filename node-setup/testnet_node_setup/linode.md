description: Guide for running the Daily Node with Docker on Linode
---

# Linode

## 1. Register to Scaleway

You can use the following link to get $100 to test out their platform:

[https://www.linode.com?r=](https://www.linode.com/?r=)

## 2. Create a API Token for Daily

You can create a API Token on this page:

[https://cloud.linode.com/profile/tokens](https://cloud.linode.com/profile/tokens)

Make a note of that key. We will use it in the next step.

_Note: If you are not sure which permissions need to be checked, you can assign all permissions._

## 3. Creating a Daily Node

{% hint style="danger" %}
If you are running this on Windows you will first need to install Windows Subsystem for Linux. You can use [this guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10).
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
The script you fetch and run in the next step depends on the network you want to deploy your node to.   Please be sure to select between mainnet and testnet as desired.
{% endhint %}

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Mainnet" %}
Download and run the node install script for the type of node you wish to deploy:

**Mainnet Full Node:**

<pre class="language-bash"><code class="lang-bash"><strong>bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dailycrypto-me/daily-ops/master/scripts/one-click-Linode.sh)" mainnet
</strong></code></pre>

**Mainnet Light Node:**

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dailycrypto-me/daily-ops/master/scripts/one-click-Linode.sh)" mainnet light
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Testnet" %}
Download and run the node install script for the type of node you wish to deploy:

**Testnet Full Node:**

<pre class="language-bash"><code class="lang-bash"><strong>bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dailycrypto-me/daily-ops/master/scripts/one-click-Linode.sh)" testnet
</strong></code></pre>

**Testnet Light Node:**

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dailycrypto-me/daily-ops/master/scripts/one-click-Linode.sh)" testnet light
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

Now you should see a new droplet in your Linode account.

_NOTE: It takes a few minutes after the droplet starts to install the Daily Node software._

## 4. Connect to your instance

### 4.1 Using password

You can find the password in the log output by the script. It is randomly generated and a 12-digit password.

### 4.2 Using SSH key pair

* You can find your SSH public key on this page: [https://cloud.linode.com/profile/keys](https://cloud.linode.com/profile/keys).
*   And you can find the new public key and private key in this directory: `~/.ssh/`.

    ```
    ls -al .ssh/ | grep "daily"
    ```

Next, you can login your instance.

## 5. Check the logs

You can use the following commands to check if the node is up and running:

```bash
sudo docker ps

sudo docker logs -f daily_compose_node_1
```
