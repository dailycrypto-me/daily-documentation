# Testnet Staking

Daily's testnet staking is a step on the path towards a successful mainnet launch, and is meant to mirror every aspect of actual mainnet operation so we may test both the technical as well as the economic aspects of the network. 

Participants will stake their DLY points earned during the Lockdrop to run a testnet node, or delegate their DLY points to testnet node operators. The staked DLY points will earn interest just like on the mainnet. 

This section is still under construction, it will cover the following topics, 

* Running a testnet node
* Staking a testnet node
* Delegating to a testnet node
* Staking yields  

More details coming soon, stay tuned!
